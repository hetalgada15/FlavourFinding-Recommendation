# AI FlavorFinder ðŸ¥—

## Introduction:

The AI FlavorFinder is a cutting-edge culinary recommendation system designed to provide users with personalized recipe suggestions based on the ingredients they have on hand. It goes beyond just offering recipes; the system also suggests restaurants serving similar dishes, enhancing both home cooking and dining-out experiences.

## Key Features:

_1. Ingredient-Based Recipe Discovery:_
 - Users can input available ingredients into the system.
 - The AI will generate a list of recipes that maximize the use of those ingredients.

Example: If a user has tomatoes, basil, and mozzarella, the system might suggest 
recipes for Caprese salad or Margherita pizza.

_2. Learning and Adaptation:_
 - If certain ingredients are not mentioned, the AI learns from the input data.
 - It can create new recipes by leveraging its learning model, o>ering the top 3 
recommended dishes based on similar recipes.

Example: If the user doesn't have a specific type of cheese, the system may suggest 
alternative recipes that use similar ingredients or suggest a different type of cheese that 
would work well.

_3. Restaurant Recommendations:_
 - The system identifies nearby restaurants that o>er similar dishes to the recipes 
suggested.
 - This feature connects the culinary exploration from the kitchen to the dining experience 
outside
